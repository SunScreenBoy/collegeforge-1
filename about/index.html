                CollegeForge is a free college advice website founded by a group of 5 students wanting to give back to the generations of students to come.
                
                <br><p><p> The biggest problem of high school was the ignorance of what to do with such an important four years of our life. Self-study AP tests? Get SATS/ACTS done with by the end of junior year? Or maybe the fact that GPA is the most important factor in college admission process. There simply wasn’t an easy way to learn about preparing for college and making ourselves the most competitive we could to attend the schools of our dreams. 
                <p>This is where we come in. CollegeForge was created by students FOR students to be the enlightenment and the clear path that all students should know. We offer an organized and consolidated database of college information from recent college admittees, in attempt to make information about college application as transparent as possible and show the human side behind students. This is especially important for future applicants since the Class of 2014’s acceptance rates have immensely dropped and will only continue declining further. 
                <p>It’s not just about numbers: GPAs, and SAT scores, but a person with their own struggles and unique personality.
