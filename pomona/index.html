                    <br>
                    <i>  Some don'ts: It's really obvious when you're trying too hard to be clever or smart or even just overly conversational in an essay. Don't write so much to impress; just embrace your own style. Don't make your essay into a "pity me" story. If you have an actual tragedy or struggle you want to talk about (don't try to make something of nothing) focus on how you've grown from it--not how difficult it was to overcome. Don't brag about your achievements (that goes elsewhere in your app). 
<br>
Be smart about which colleges you apply to. For one it costs you or your parents extra money. And secondly, it's a lot of extra work. Though you can sometimes get away with using the same essay twice for supplements, it's often pretty obvious and too generic and you risk not getting into either school (this doesn't apply if you're only applying to UC's/states). Instead, invest that extra time into a few colleges to which you can actually see yourself going.
<br>
Lastly, don't be intimidated by the process or carry the notion that this is a very exact and precise measure of your worth. It's easy to get swept up in the admissions process, but you'd be surprised to discover how arbitrary it can be. Berkeley assigns applicants a number, 1-5, based on criteria that can be as vague as "adding diversity" or "helping build the class." And the same goes for any top tier university. Though it's not easy, you have to take the admissions process with a grain of salt. </i>

                    <label class="control-label">What essay topics did you write about?</label>
                    <br>
                    <i>For my common app essay, I wrote about my views on education and creativity--a pretty vague answer to the prompt about responding to a challenge. This was my first essay. I started it in July or August and had I started later, might have taken a different approach, but it seemed to go over well enough anyway.
<br>
For my "extracurricular" UC essay, I wrote about volunteering at the Niles Film Museum and what movies meant to me. For my other UC essay, I wrote about Fremont and living in diversity--pretty generic but I thought it was a stupid topic and put my main focus on the extracurricular essay.
<br>
For my supplement essays, I wrote about a variety of things depending on the school and topic. Sometimes about a movie I really liked, sometimes about my career plans. Not sure if this is the best idea because it can backfire if you're not careful about it, but I tried to embrace the school's general philosophy and make myself seem like a match for a particular school. For instance, my Brown essay focused on the open-ended/open-minded type of education offered there, while my Pomona essay focused on creativity and discovery (something that I figured a small liberal arts school like Pomona would appreciate). This of course means you can't repeat essays (for the most part), but I think that's a good idea anyway. I also tried to name-drop a few professors who taught or did research in a subject I was interested in. Not sure if that helped me or not, but I'm guessing it did help a bit for my Northwestern and Carnegie Mellon apps.</i>
