                    <i>I know it sounds obvious, but focus on what you've done that RELATES TO YOUR MAJOR!  You don't have room for fluff. Even though you should avoid fluff, don't sell yourself short. You know that your essays are just a snippet of your accomplishments, but the college readers do not.  They are expecting you to be bragging about all of your accomplishments, so ACTUALLY BRAG without being stuck-up.To overcome this problem, write a really crazy draft essay where you brag as much as of yourself likes some overconfident person.  Then edit it down to something presentable.  You don't have to make that your final essay, but it should bring things to mind that you wouldn't have seen otherwise.

<br>

Personality is a necessity in your essays.  They already have access to your grades; you HAVE TO show them what type of person you are through your writing style and your "personal quality, talent, accomplishment, contribution or experience" in the second personal statement. Everyone is already talking about grades and volunteering and clubs.  What separates you are your hardships, hobbies, and most importantly, personality.  Be genuine (or rather, don't be fake).

<br>

Take advantage of your resources when proofreading.  Yes, obviously have parents and other seniors proofread your essays, but let's be honest, they don't have experience.  Definitely do not let your parents change your essay much -- this is YOUR ESSAY, it should read naturally as if you were speaking, not your parents.  Parents are best for grammar checks though...

I think the best people to ask to review your essays are the college application people who come over to the high school.  (You seek them out, they won't come to you.)

Other good proofreaders are english teachers and college students.  They have college level writing experience and the college students have first hand experience that is (relatively) fresh in their mind.  Do not be afraid to ask anybody.  If they help, great -- if they say no, you didn't want their help anyway.

Start your essays early with teachers because they will not have time to read your essays later when everyone else also wants their personal statements reviewed.

<br>

The essay topics for UC Applications have stayed the same for years; don't expect them to change.  At least have a draft/outline of the essays before people start getting on the College Application hype train.  This serves as good practice.

Here is a link to the personal statement prompts for people who do not know: http://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/how-to-apply/personal-statement/  </i>

                    <br>
                    <i>Freshman applicant prompt:
My relation with my family and other HS students working on a high-end robot and game development.  I learned how to work with others on high level projects outside of school, and how it shaped my choice in majors.
<br>

Prompt for all applicants:
I wrote about having a creative imagination and being good at visualizing plans/diagrams in my head.  Worse than my first essay, but I believe I salvaged it by linking it to my accomplishments and hinting why it would show how I was prepared for college.

If I were to do this essay again, I would focus on ONE THING.  For me, it would be magic.  There is no obvious educational benefit from performing sleight of hand, but it touches on something I didn't mention in my first essay.  It's my hobby, and this is their way to get to know you.

If they actually met you in person and learned more than just your grades, you'd probably get into the top colleges.  But you won't meet them in person, so these personal statementsessays are the best you've got.

For my Private College essays, I just copied my best personal statement (the first one).  Ain't nobody got time for that!

You'll do well wherever you go.  This is really tough to see until you actually go through with the whole process, but it's true.  It's what you bring to your education that defines your success, not the reputation of the college.
<br>
If you don't get into a school you're super happy about, after four years as a successful undergrad, you will be able to become a grad student researching at top schools, no problem.</i>
