                    <i> Believe in what you write. No matter what you want to write, you have to have a passion for it. Even if you’re writing your essays, and halfway through, you suddenly have an epiphany on a good idea of what to write, feel free to rewrite the essays (don’t be afraid about being “too far” into the other idea). 
                        <br>
 Choose schools not for the name, but for their strengths. Not every school is strong in everything, and it’s important to apply to schools that are good at what you’re interested in studying, or on the other side of the spectrum, give you a lot of opportunities to explore if you’re not sure what you want to do.
 <br>
Apply to schools that you can actually see yourself going to. Don’t waste time on other schools just because it may sound appealing or as a random safety. You’d rather spend time perfecting few apps that you have, rather than spreading your attention over many mediocre applications.
<br>
 Have a good balance of reach, match, and safety schools. I would perhaps point to a fraction of 3/8 reach, 3/8 match, and 2/8 safeties. Reach for the stars, because you never know!
<br>
 Do not be general in your essays. Point to specific school programs or areas of the school that you will benefit from, and it will show through how much you can benefit from the school.
<br>
Apply early. There may be rumors that kids who apply early may be of a “higher” calibre, but the truth is, they’re just kids applying to a school they really want to go to. It won’t hurt to apply early, it’ll get you started early, and you can even recycle essays later. </i>

 Everyone goes in undeclared: This is a phenomenal opportunity for students, because it means that you don’t have to apply to specific colleges or schools and bind yourself to a degree. You have time to explore whatever you want until the end of sophomore year, when you declare. 
<br>
 Interdisciplinary programs: Stanford is always looking to bridge the techie and fuzzie divide by combining the technical skills and logical understanding. Whether it is Symbolic Systems, Human Biology, or the new CS+X initiative, Stanford creates degrees to create technically savvy and logically aware individuals.
<br>
 Always improving themselves: Stanford is always improving their humanities and arts departments, and they will only continue to soar over the next years. 
<br>
 Co-Terming: If you want a master’s, you can choose to complete your master’s in only 5 years by applying to this program so you can stay at Stanford and continue to further your research and studies. A lot of people do this to try a new field or to explore their original bachelor degrees in greater depth.
<br>
 Nearness to Silicon Valley and the Bay Area: Yes, it’s amazing to be so close to so many opportunities for any type of degree.
<br>
Weather: It’s Bay Area cali weather!

Also CS + English (part of a new “CS+X” joint major initiative, more info here: https://undergrad.stanford.edu/academic-planning/majors-minors/joint-majors-csx)</i>
